		<h2>Our Statement of Solidarity with Black Lives Matter</h2>
	</div>

<p></p>

<div class="col-lg text-left">


<p>We would be failing at our mission of reducing healthcare disparities if we did not speak out regarding the current social situation.  We wholeheartedly support the Black Lives Matter movement and the protesters demanding institutional change.  </p>

<p>Racism is systemic and multiform, ranging from blatant police brutality, white supremacy, and the murder of our community members to subtle forms of discrimination. Science and healthcare have historically exploited and downcast the needs of Black Americans. The scientific and medical community must do better to address these disparities. We must all be committed to not only opposing racism, but to also being actively anti-racist. This includes educating ourselves and one another on how we can work to eliminate injustice, oppression, and inequity. We must examine our own practices and do more to include people of color in science, medicine and research.</p>

<p>Below, we have included a list of resources on racial inequalities in healthcare.</p>

<p></p>
<h3>EDUCATE</h3>
<p></p>

African Americans are 20 percent more likely to die from heart disease . 

<a class="nav-link" href="https://tcf.org/content/report/racism-inequality-health-care-african-americans/?session=1">TCF Report on Racism's Influence on Health Care Inequality</a>

<p></p>
<h3>ACTIVATE</h3>
<p></p>


<p>In order to ensure lasting change, we must translate our education into policy at a local and federal level. We need to press our mayors, governors, and representatives on making real change to racial inequality and injustice. </p>

<p>Socioeconomic status is one of the primary drivers of health outcomes and exacerbates healthcare disparities for black Americans. We support an investigation of solutions to address wealth inequality by passing H.R. 40. This legislation would create a commission to study the historic effects of slavery and discrimination and recommend appropriate remedies. We cannot move forward as a nation without fully understanding and confronting the failures of our past.  
Slavery and segregation were systems of legalized white supremacy for which generations of Black people were monetized to benefit white people and their economic systems. Well into the 21st century, many have paid with their lives. This bill must be addressed to recompense. We encourage you to educate yourself on H.R. 40 and make your voice heard by voting. </p>

<p></p>
<h3>TAKE ACTION</h3>
<p></p>

<p>Hire people of color- recruit from HBCU’s and minority serving institutions</p>

<p>Spend time and energy involving underrepresented minorities in studies and clinical trials</p>
